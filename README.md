## Shit you might want to know about my ZSH config...

1. I open new shells in the same directory I left off in another (very last
   `cd`). This confuses the fuck out of people but once you start using it
   you'll never switch back.
2. My tmux config on OS X is a hurt piece. `reattach-to-user-namespace` slows
   new shells like molasses. Something I need to get rid of and is also why
   recently I've found I'm far more productive working under a *NIX than macOS.
