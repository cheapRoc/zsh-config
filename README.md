## Shit you might want to know about my ZSH config...

1. I open new shells at the same place I left off in another. This confuses the
   fuck out of people but once you start using it, you'll almost never go back.
2. My tmux config on OS X is a hurt piece. `reattach-to-user-namespace` slows
   new shells like molasses.
